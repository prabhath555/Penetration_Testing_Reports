# Penetration Testing on DVWA

Welcome to the repository for completing penetration testing on DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application). This project aims to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in DVWA and compile a detailed report on the findings.

## Project Objectives

1. **Penetration Testing**: Perform thorough penetration testing on DVWA to identify and exploit vulnerabilities.
2. **Reporting**: Compile and submit a comprehensive report detailing the findings, vulnerabilities, exploitation techniques, and remediation recommendations.

## Project Structure

- `dvwa-testing/`: Contains scripts, tools, and documentation related to the penetration testing of DVWA.
- `reports/`: Contains the detailed penetration testing report.

## Prerequisites

1. Install Docker to set up and run DVWA.
2. Ensure you have the necessary tools for penetration testing (e.g., Nmap, Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP).

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/prabhath555/Penetration_testing_Reports.git
    cd Penetration_testing_Reports
    ```

2. **Set up DVWA using Docker**:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
    DVWA should now be running and accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

3. **Configure DVWA**:
    - Open DVWA in your browser.
    - Login with default credentials (`admin` / `password`).
    - Set up the database.

## Penetration Testing Process

1. **Reconnaissance**:
    - Perform network scanning using Nmap to identify open ports and services.
    - Use tools like Nikto to identify potential vulnerabilities.

2. **Vulnerability Assessment**:
    - Use automated tools (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Nessus) to scan DVWA for known vulnerabilities.
    - Manually inspect the application to find and understand potential vulnerabilities.

3. **Exploitation**:
    - Attempt to exploit identified vulnerabilities.
    - Document each step of the exploitation process, including tools and techniques used.

4. **Post-Exploitation**:
    - Analyze the impact of successfully exploited vulnerabilities.
    - Suggest remediation steps to mitigate identified vulnerabilities.

## Reporting

1. **Create the Report**:
    - Document each phase of the penetration testing process.
    - Include details of identified vulnerabilities, exploitation techniques, and impact analysis.
    - Provide recommendations for remediation.

2. **Submit the Report**:
    - Save the report in the `reports/` directory as `Penetration_Testing_Report.md` or `Penetration_Testing_Report.pdf`.
    - Ensure the report is comprehensive and easy to understand.

## Example Tools

- **Reconnaissance**: Nmap, AngryIPScanner
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: OWASP ZAP, Nessus
- **Exploitation**: Burp Suite, Metasploit
